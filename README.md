# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project is a mobile app for recommending movies & shows. I will be using React Native to develop this mobile app with ExpoGO. This project is done to help me understand the workflow of React Native. I will be using the TMDb API to pull latest movies and display it in my app. The app will ideally allow users to search for movies and it will also feature a movie recommendation system.
